The DLC Generator tool is geared towards marine energy design conditions. In essence, the tool is intended to help marine energy developers obtain design load conditions, including 1- and 50-year sea states. These return periods are requirements according to [{{site.doc-name}}]({{site.doc-link}}).

### The Tool

1. Collects site data from over 7.9 million unique sources of modeled and measured data.
2. Uses quality-controlled site data to quantify stochastic sea states through different validated and accepted statistical approaches.
3. Generates surface elevation time series from the stochastic sea states for use in numerical modeling or wave tank testing.
4. Performs extreme response analysis on the results of tank testing or numerical modeling to quantify extreme characteristics.


This documentation section does not cover the theory behind the scenes, please see the [theory docs]({{site.url}}/theory/) for details on implementations and references.
